# Iris Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of Iris flowers using machine learning techniques. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory purposes. The goal of this project is to build and train a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The dataset provides measurements for four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
